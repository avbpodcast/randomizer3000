This page generates random numbers and BIP39 words for a seedphrase using user input or external entropy sources (e.g., Swatch .beats, Block Height, HTTP Latency, Bxl Rail Traffic, LavaRand, Dice Roll). Randomness is influenced by Light/Dark mode (jump calculation), salt level, and the chosen entropy source. For best use, run locally for basic, secure functionality (offline), or online with all external sources enabled for maximum entropy.
